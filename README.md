# About

This is my game for the OMGJam4 (one mechnaic jam). The themes were *Food*,
*Loot*, and *Gravity*.

Voyage is about controlling the speed and physics of your one-of-a-kind
interstellar shipping vessel to strategically supply colonial planets. They need
foot, supplies, and people. In return they'll give you loot which you can bring
back to other planets which might leave more supplies or better loot for you in
orbit. All you gotta do is get in the right orbits.

# Resources

This project uses Love2D. To build/run it, just follow the usual instructions
on Love's website. (Either download Love, or package it yourself.) With this
being a work in progress project, I won't be releasing any official binaries
for a while, except on itch for the jam itself.
